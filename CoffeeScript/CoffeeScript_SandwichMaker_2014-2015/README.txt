This is some code of the web-app I was working on recently - my awesome client has no problem with sharing a bit of my code ;) I was using Meteor.js framework, which is awesome - so much less trouble making a webapp. The scripts are in Coffee Script

In test there is automated functional test example with webdriver.io/mocha.js
