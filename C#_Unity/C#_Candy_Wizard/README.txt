Here are C# scripts that for the Candy Wizard game, I was working on during my summer internship. The game is a part of  bundle of 6 games, made with Unity so it is not able to compile a game out of this scripts.
Some script classes, such as CandyWizardGameManager extend or use classes from Common folder, which was done by various team members, as those classes were used for all the games from the bundle.
